| 1. Hothouse is a firm which produces design software.                                              |    |  X  |
| 2. Sleekware was written for a single, specific purpose.                                           |    |  X  |
| 3. Tom blames faulty hardware for Sleekware’s printing problems.                                   |  X |     |
| 4. Jerry reports that the people at Hothouse are completely dissatisfied with the Sleekware program.|   |  X  |
| 5. Tom is annoyed that the Hothouse people didn’t follow his hardware recommendations.             |  X |     |
|6. The Hothouse people were eager to buy Sleekware.                                                 |    |  X  |
|7. There is nothing Tom can do or suggest to help Jerry with the problem.                           |    |  X  |

**Jerry**: Uh, Tom have you got a minute?\
**Tom**: Well …\
**Jerry**: Look, I know you’re busy and I wouldn’t bother you if the Hothouse people weren’t breaking down my door, but …\
**Tom**: That’s OK, Jerry. No problem. Come in and have a seat. I suppose it’s about the appliance design software we put together for them, that *Multipurpose* program.\
**Jerry**: That’s right – Sleekware we called it.\
**Tom**: So?\
**Jerry**: Well, they really like Sleekware’s *user interface* - it’s faster and more stable than the parent program. They only wish they’d had it all along. It would have saved them a lot of time and *hassle*. The thing is…\
**Tom**: Out with it.\
**Jerry**: It’s the product planning part of the program. When they try to print their cost calculations they get *garbled output*.\
**Tom**: The printing routines we used are absolutely standard and were *thoroughly* tested.\
**Jerry**: I realize that but I’m getting a lot of *flak* from these Hothouse people – hotheads would be a better name for them. Can’t you do some kind of work around?\
**Tom**: That’s not the point. It would be a waste of time and energy to try and doctor up a piece of perfectly sound software. When we were there the program ran *smoothly* and they had no complaints. The question is: Have they changed anything since?\
**Jerry**: Yes, you remember they said they wanted to invest in a couple of new printers and print servers.\
**Tom**: And what did they end up buying?\
**Jerry**: Quickie Print.\
**Tom**: Well, no wonder they’re having trouble. I *recommended* Jewel Packets. If they’d followed my advice and invested a few more hundred in decent hardware they wouldn’t be having these problems. We should have *pushed the point* more.\
**Jerry**: Maybe, but it was a hard sell. If we’d made it a *condition*, I’m afraid we would have *lost the contract*.\
**Tom**: Could be but it’s too late now. My only suggestion at this point would be to lend them a printer and print server. If the software runs smoothly – and I’m sure it will – it would prove I’m right and that it’s their hardware and not our program that’s at fault.\
**Jerry**: Good, that’s a  fair offer  - I’ll get back to you on that.

## Programming Logic

[Worksheet](./prog_lang_4.pdf)

### 4. Every program logic consists of three main structural elements: Sequenz, Selection and Iteration (loop). Which is which?

a. *Sequenz* is a series of command wherby B automatically and necessarily follows A.
b. *Iteration (loop)* repeats a given sequenz of commands as long as given conditions exists or until a given condition is fullfilled.
c. *Selection* executes one of two or more possible functions in a program depending on whatever a given condition has been fulfilled or not

### 5. Structoral elements

| Structure | Definition |
|-----------|------------|
| 1         | b          |
| 2         | h          |
| 3         | c          |
| 4         | g          |
| 5         | i          |
| 6         | d          |
| 7         | a          |
| 8         | f          |
| 9         | e          |
